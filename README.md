I'm a statistical consultant in the life sciences, working with transcriptomic, microbiome, and gene-gene interaction data. I received my PhD from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where my dissertation topic was forensic DNA mixture deconvolution.

I mainly work in Python and R, but my first programming experience was in C++, and I have interest in lower-level languages to optimize scientific algorithms for speed.
